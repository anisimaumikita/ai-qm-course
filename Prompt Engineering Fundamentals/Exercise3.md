## Task

A junior QA on your team is trying to test an LLM's ability to review code for bugs. They use the following prompt:

> **Flawed Prompt:**
> 
> "Here is a Python function. Please find the obvious off-by-one indexing error in the 'for' loop and also look for the SQL injection vulnerability. Tell me what you find."

---

> **Questions**

- **Identify** which anti-pattern (discussed in the article) this prompt suffers from.
- **Explain** why this prompt makes it a bad or invalid test.
- **Rewrite** the prompt to be a neutral, effective test of the model's bug-finding capabilities, using a proper Role and Task.
