# Exercise 1: Quick vs Thinking Mode in Test Planning

<p align="right">Date: <strong>2026-02-27</strong></p>

---

## 📝 Task

Use this structured prompt format to strengthen reasoning:
```text
“List constraints, risks, and unknowns for the checkout flow.”
“Propose key test cases to validate functionality.”
“Summarize validation metrics and rollback strategy.”
```
Explain when Thinking mode improves QA outcomes versus when Quick mode is enough.

## ✅ Result

# QA Review Evaluation

---

## 1️⃣ Traceability Review

### ✅ Strengths

Good implicit traceability to major risk areas:

- Double charge prevention
- Payment ↔ order atomicity
- Inventory oversell
- Discount correctness
- Webhook duplication
- Reconciliation

These risks appear consistently across:

- Test cases
- Validation metrics
- Rollback strategy

That shows structural alignment.

---

### ⚠ Gaps in Traceability

#### A. No Explicit Risk → Test Mapping

There is no formal mapping such as:

> Risk: “Payment captured but order not created”  
> → Test Cases 34, 39  
> → Validation Metric: Order creation success rate  
> → Rollback trigger: Payment/order mismatch spike  

This mapping exists conceptually — but not visibly.

**Impact:**  
Harder for stakeholders to verify coverage completeness.

---

#### B. No Requirement-Level Anchoring

The output lacks references like:

- Functional requirement IDs
- Business rules (e.g., promo stacking rules v2.3)
- Compliance requirements (PCI, tax law logic)

Without this, traceability is architectural — not contractual.

---

#### C. Observability-to-Test Trace Missing

Metrics mention:

- Checkout success rate
- Payment error spike
- Reconciliation checks

But there is no direct mapping of:

> Production Signal → Preventive Test Case

Example:

> Payment provider latency spike  
> → Do we have timeout simulation tests?

This feedback loop is implied but not formalized.

---

### **Traceability Score: 7.5 / 10**

Good systemic alignment, missing formal linkage structure.

---

## 2️⃣ Test Clarity Review

### ✅ Strengths

- Clear separation by domain (Cart, Payment, Inventory, Security).
- Functional and edge cases separated logically.
- High-risk scenarios explicitly highlighted.
- No vague tests like “verify checkout works.”
- Most test cases are atomic and readable.

---

### ⚠ Clarity Gaps

#### A. Missing Expected Results Detail

Example:

> “Gateway timeout → safe retry behavior”

What defines “safe”?

- Retry once?
- Exponential backoff?
- No duplicate capture?

Tests describe intent but not acceptance criteria.

---

#### B. Some Tests Are Behavior-Level, Not Validation-Level

Example:

> “Session expiration handled securely.”

Handled how?

- Redirect to login?
- Cart preserved?
- Payment invalidated?

Ambiguity reduces automation readiness.

---

#### C. No Data Strategy Mentioned

Missing clarity on:

- Boundary values (max coupon %, max quantity)
- Invalid input combinations
- Concurrency volumes

Functional intent is clear, but test data precision is not.

---

### **Test Clarity Score: 8 / 10**

Readable and structured, but lacks measurable acceptance detail.

---

## 3️⃣ Risk Alignment Review

### ✅ Strong Risk Coverage Areas

High-risk financial scenarios are well covered:

- Idempotency
- Double charge
- Webhook duplication
- Inventory concurrency
- Price drift
- Reconciliation

These are the correct high-impact checkout risks.

That reflects mature prioritization.

---

### ⚠ Risk Blind Spots

#### A. Fraud & Abuse Not Deeply Covered

Fraud checks are mentioned, but not tested deeply:

- Velocity checks
- Stolen card behavior
- Coupon abuse automation

Risk acknowledged → not fully validated.

---

#### B. Performance Under Peak Load

There is a generic SLA test, but no:

- Concurrency simulation definition
- Payment gateway degradation strategy
- Partial outage scenario

Checkout risk during peak traffic is underrepresented.

---

#### C. State Recovery Risk

Good coverage of:

- Webhook duplication
- Double click

But weaker coverage of:

- Multi-step back navigation corruption
- Mid-checkout deployment
- Schema version compatibility during rollback

---

### **Risk Alignment Score: 8.5 / 10**

Strong on financial integrity, moderate on abuse and resilience modeling.

---

## 4️⃣ Validation Metrics Review

### Strengths

- Financial integrity emphasized
- Order creation after payment must be 100%
- Monitoring readiness considered
- Reconciliation explicitly included

This is aligned with production safety.

---

### Gaps

- No baseline thresholds defined (what is acceptable failure rate?)
- No leading indicator separation from lagging metrics
- No statistical smoothing (rolling averages, p95 drift bands)

Metrics are directionally correct but not operationally hardened.

---

## 5️⃣ Rollback Strategy Review

### Strengths

- Prioritizes financial consistency
- Feature flags included
- Canary deployment included
- Reconciliation plan included
- Idempotency protection during rollback noted

This is strong architectural maturity.

---

### Gaps

- No rollback validation checklist (what must be verified post-rollback?)
- No RTO/RPO targets defined
- No specific trigger thresholds defined
- No playbook sequencing (who acts first?)

Strategy is structurally sound but operational detail is light.

---

## 6️⃣ Overall QA Review Summary

| Dimension            | Score     | Commentary |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| Traceability        | 7.5/10    | Conceptually aligned, not explicitly mapped |
| Test Clarity        | 8/10      | Clear structure, lacks measurable acceptance criteria |
| Risk Alignment      | 8.5/10    | Strong financial focus, lighter on fraud & peak load |
| Metric Maturity     | 7.5/10    | Good signals, missing thresholds & trend modeling |
| Rollback Robustness | 8/10      | Architecturally sound, needs operational detail |

---

### **Overall Maturity: Senior QA level (not yet enterprise-hardened).**

---

## What Would Elevate It to Enterprise-Grade?

- Add a formal Risk → Test → Metric → Rollback trace matrix
- Define measurable acceptance criteria for each high-risk test
- Introduce leading vs lagging metric classification
- Add fraud/abuse modeling test scenarios
- Define rollback trigger thresholds numerically
- Add post-rollback validation checklist

---

## Final QA Verdict (as in a real review session)

If this were presented in a QA design review:

### **Decision: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS**

**Conditions:**

- Add explicit traceability matrix
- Harden acceptance criteria
- Define metric thresholds
- Expand peak-load and fraud modeling coverage

The foundation is strong and risk-aware. It needs formalization and measurable precision to reach production-grade governance.
